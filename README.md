# AI-Based-Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-System
Using deep learning models to accurately classify breast cancer from ultrasound images, improving early and non-invasive diagnosis.


* Dataset:  3000+ Ultrasound breast images labeled benign/malignant, augmented with rotation, zoom.
* Models Evaluated: Custom CNN, VGG16, EfficientNetB0.

Training: Binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, early stopping, 20 epochs max, batch size 32, 20% validation split.

Â Evaluation Metrics: Validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC.

* Outcomes:

 - The custom CNN performed best with 80.78% accuracy and good generalization.
 - VGG16 was close behind at 80.22%, benefiting from transfer learning.
 - EfficientNetB0 lagged at 55.56%, likely due to limited fine-tuning and dataset fit.
